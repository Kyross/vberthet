I am currently studying IT Image Synthesis in the Ecole Supérieur d’Ingénieurs de Rennes (ESIR – Rennes 1), and I wish you the welcome on my Portfolio!</p><p> For <span id='bio_duration'></span> years, computing and electronic and media have taken a more and more part on my free time. First of all, I have started as a self-educated and I did many projects to discover deeper both fields to understand what I would like to do as a professional.</p><p>In this way I have decided to continue my further studies in a first time in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Computing for 2 years, in order to learn more about computing and to find out new field like automation and embedded computing which I have interest in.</p><p>Finally, after this degree I made the decision to study one year in a foreign country in a Game Development Bachelor’s Degree in Glasgow (University of the West of Scotland). This was an incredible human experience where I have discovered deeper a culture, met a lot of international people as well as features of computing. Moreover, it obviously helped improve my English, which is an omnipresent skill in my daily life.</p><p>The whole of these challenges and choices have significantly enriched my personality, especially to understand better aspects of communication and to make my professional project.</p><p>Cheers</p>"
